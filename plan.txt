DNS mocking

* resolver in the nginx config - requires changing the nginx config to make the tests work

* resolv_wrapper - would require nginx source code changes :-/

* docker with resolv.conf or hosts overrides and/or dnsmasq - Complex but probably workable
 * And running in a container/vm would help with FS mocking too
